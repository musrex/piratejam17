## Introduction  
---
####  Game Summary

This will be a relatively simple and small game. There is a platform with two 
players or combatants. Only one person, however, can remain on the platform.  
  
Think Sumo Wrestling.  
  
####  Inspiration 

Inspiration for this game came from my wife. We were brainstorming and she said 
"what about a game about a prophet or resurrection, like Avatar. And there can 
be platforms..." and that's when I thought: PLATFORMS! ONE! AIR BENDERS?  
  
There will most likely be no Air Benders in the game, but there will be pushing 
people off platforms.  
  
#### Player Experience  
  
Ideally there will be multiple platforms (i.e. levels) and multiple enemy types. 
Which of these makes the cut will be determined by time and skill.  
  
Given an abundance of both time and skill, the player would be presented with a 
variety of levels and enemy types, each requiring a bit of persistance (button 
mashing), quick thinking, and luck.  
  
#### Platform  
  
The game is being developed in Godot's compatibilitty mode with the express 
intent of it being released to Itch.io.  
  
#### Development Software  
  
- Aseprite for Art assets
- Godot for game development
- Beepbox for music

#### Genre

The genre be 2D action/puzzle. The puzzle element will come in the form of 
figuring out how to push off the enemy, and the action comes in the form of the 
speed and real time controls.

#### Target Audience  
  
The Target Audience are fans of indie games, particularly games with shorter 
runs. 

### Concept  
---  
####  Gameplay Overview

The gameplay will be simple. Players can move left or right and jump. They can 
also build momentum. This will either be in the form of a timed the space bar, 
or by running and building the momentum. Failure to correctly time the space 
bar will result in a penalty - they player's character will stumble and be 
vulnerable. As players win and knock enemies off their platforms, they will 
ascend to the next, higher platform. Eventually they will reach the top, 
smallest platform and be the only player remaining. 

#### Theme Intepretation (Only One)  
  
My interpretation of the theme, and the way in which it manifests, is pretty 
literal -- there can only be one player left on the platform. To extend that, 
the platform, or really platforms, will take shape of ledges on a mountain side.
 The players will all be goats who are trying to push each other of the ledges.
At the end of the game, there will only be one goat left standing.

#### Primary Mechanics  
  
The primary mechanics are movement - left, right, jump. This is what the player
 will use to navigate the platforms and environments.

#### Secondary Mechanics

The secondary mechanics will all involve building momentum. Players can build 
momentum by running and maintaining it that way, or they can correctly time 
their space bar press to short cut it. Failure correctly time it will result in 
the player stumbling and being vulnerable to an enemy pushing them off.
